            I turn manual testing workflows into fast, scalable, developer-friendly automation systems.
            Whether it is building frameworks from scratch, or streamlining CI/CD pipelines,
            I help engineering teams adopt and maintain high-quality automated tests.

        <h2>What I bring to the table</h2>

        <h3>Deep technical expertise:</h3>
        <p>I've created test automation frameworks from scratch in the game industry where such tool hardly exist.</p>

        <h3>Strategist:</h3>
        <p>I don't automate everything, I automate what matters. I gather the right information before building the
            solution that works best for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Not just test automation, but <u>QA automation</u>:</h3>
        <p>Test automation is only a subset of what I do. I approach QA holistically to use my expertise most
            effectively. This means collaborating with a wide variety of teams to push for quality wherever it is
            needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Excellent communicator:</h3>
        <p>I can convey complex ideas and analyses to larger audiences. I've talked online live and on stage, breaking
            down my expertise for everyone to learn from my experiences. I'm also well versed in writing documentation
            to help spread best practices inside an organization.
